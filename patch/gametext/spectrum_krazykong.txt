ZX Spectrum 48K - Krazy Kong

Can you rescue jane from the clutches of the evil
kong?

There are four different screens in this version of 
Krazy Kong and each has various combinations of 
barrels, fireballs, pies, conveyor belts, lifts and
flans.
Bonus points are available for picking up the water
buckets.

The game gets harder as it goes on, with all the 
obstacles speeding up and the bonus score decreasing 
faster. If the bonus is allowed to reach zero, you 
lose a life.
