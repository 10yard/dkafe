Commodore 64 - Donkey Kong Junior (2014)

What a template this game is for how to handle a port!
The graphics are exceptional, the music some of the 
best you will hear on the Commodore and the 
platforming addictively fun!

The main gameplay itself is as near arcade perfect as 
can possibly be, and is quite simply the best home 
8-bit version of all.
