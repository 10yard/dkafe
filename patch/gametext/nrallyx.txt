New Rally-X

New Rally-X is a scrolling, overhead maze-based racing
game in which the player drives a racing car and must 
collect ten yellow flags before the fuel runs out. 
Red enemy cars pursue and try to ram into and destroy 
the player's car. 

If the player's car runs into a wall, it will turn 
automatically and continue moving. To disrupt the 
chasing enemy cars a smoke-screen can be activated 
behind the player's car, causing any pursuing vehicles
to crash.  Activating the smoke uses a significant 
amount of fuel, so be careful to not overuse it.

Each maze also has rock formations and crashing into 
these will result in the loss of a player car. A radar
display to the right-hand side of the playing area 
shows the positions of the flags, rocks and enemies.
