Pac & Pal

Pac-Man has a new friend named Miru, but she tries to
grab the fruit and take it to the ghost pen. Pac-Man
now not only has to collect the stuff lying around the
board, but he must also watch Miru to make sure she 
doesn't take the stuff for her own use.

This game is a proper sequel to Super Pac-Man, 
maintaining elements such as doors and eating fruit 
instead of dots. In addition to Miru, Pac-Man can 
obtain a stun ability; He can enter the ghost pen; 
There are bonus rounds; and there is music playing 
throughout the level.
