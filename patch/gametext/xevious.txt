Xevious

Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up in which
the player pilots the heavily-armed 'Solvalou' combat 
ship and must destroy the evil Xevious forces trying 
to take over the planet. The Solvalou is equipped with
two weapon systems; the forwards-firing "air zapper" 
for shooting air-based enemies and 'blaster bombs', 
for destroying ground-based enemies.
