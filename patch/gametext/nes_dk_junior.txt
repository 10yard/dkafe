NES Console - Donkey Kong Junior

Mario has gone mad! He's turned the tables on Donkey
Kong and locked him in a cage. It's up to you, as 
Donkey Kong Jr., to rescue your father by stealing 
Mario's set of keys. But it won't be easy. 
You'll have to fight off ape-eating Snapjaws, jump 
onto moving islands and break through a jungle of 
vines to get to the keys that will free Donkey Kong. 

Can you handle the action? Because this off-the-wall 
monkey business will have you going bananas!
