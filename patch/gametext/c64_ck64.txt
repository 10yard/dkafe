Commodore 64 - Crazy Kong 64

A mixture of Donkey Kong and (sort of) Pac Man.

You have to progress up the platforms and reach the 
top while collecting little diamonds on the way.

The levels themselves are pretty original. The first
one is reminiscent of the first level of Donkey Kong, 
although the barrels run at high speed along 
horizontal! platforms (No incline whatever). 
The following ones are originals that have the feel of 
Donkey Kong, but add new features.
