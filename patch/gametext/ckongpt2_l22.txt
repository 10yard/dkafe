Donkey Kong Killscreen L=22

You get to play the infamous Crazy Kong Killscreen!
Your game beings at Level 22.

You will only get a few seconds before your timer
runs out so you must try to score as many points as 
possible.

It is possible to perform a stage skip trick by 
jumping off the right hand side of the second girder.
There is a bug which allows Jumpman to fall through 
the floor.  It will take some practice to regularly
pull of this trick but when you do you will get more 
points than would normally be possible.

Good luck!
