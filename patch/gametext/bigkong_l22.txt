Big Kong Killscreen L=22

You get to play the Big Kong Killscreen level!
Your game beings at Level 22.

You will only get a few seconds before your timer
runs out so you must try to score as many points as 
possible.

Big Kong starts on the Pies stage,  so if you are
really quick you can get to the barrels stage. You
have until the timer gets down to "3600" due to a 
bug in the original programming.

Good luck!
