Donkey Kong On The Run

This time Donkey Kong has not only kidnapped Pauline.
He also sabotaged the boards. Because of that he is 
On The Run! 

Sabotages include randomly broken ladders, twice as 
much wild barrels, blinking hammers, closely-spaced 
pies and in-between springs. All the sabotages result 
in a more brutal game that is a lot harder to play.
