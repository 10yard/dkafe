Donkey Kong Level Zero (Zero Sense)

Weird things happen when you play Donkey Kong on 
Level 0.  This hack makes it possible to play this
normally inaccessible level.  There are bugs and there
are some odd gameplay mechanics.

- DK sometimes throws wild barrels at lightspeed
- Barrels can freeze and then start moving again
- Graphics can become garbled
- There are no fires on pies level 0!
- All 5 firefoxes spawn at the start of rivets

This hack was inspired by the work of Kosmic when
investigating progression beyond the killscreen.
Kosmic also looked at behaviour of other advanced and
normally unattainable levels.
