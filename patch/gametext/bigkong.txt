Big Kong

That crazy monkey has carried off your girlfriend. 
You must rescue her by climbing ladders and riding 
elevators while avoiding barrels, fireballs and pies.

This clone retains gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, 
but has the graphics redrawn and re-colorised. 

Ladders on the barrel stage are in different positions
and rise higher than usual. They can be used to ascend 
two or three beams at a time, making it more difficult.
