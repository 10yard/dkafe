Donkey Kong Randomized Edition

In this romhack each board is selected randomly: a 
random level (between 1 and 5) and a random screen 
(barrels, pies, springs, rivets). 

The selection of each board is random without knowing 
what it selected before. To get a more interesting
game for skilled Donkey Kong players, the 
randomization doesn't distribute the levels and 
screens evenly.
