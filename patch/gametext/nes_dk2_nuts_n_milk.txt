NES Console - DK 2 (Nuts and Milk Hack)

A hack of the Nuts and Milk NES game.
Help Mario rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong while being
chased down by enemies.  

The game dynamics are a little different to regular 
Donkey Kong.  You can run through and climb up into 
the hatched areas.

It's a mixed bag, fun levels, easy levels and 
challenging levels.
