MS-DOS - Aldo's Assault

Part 3 of the Aldo series of games. All of the Aldo
games play similarly to the classic Donkey Kong games. 
Aldo even looks strikingly similar to everyone's 
favorite video game plumber. 
There seems to be a slight problem with collision-
detection on the first level, where Aldo sometimes 
will jump through a certain platform ... but other 
than that, this game seems to play just as well as the
others in the series.
