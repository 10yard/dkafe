VIC-20 - Witch Way

A single screen Donkey Kong style game where you 
start off in a big black cauldron with a damsel in 
distress at the bottom of the screen. 

Your mission is to get to the top where the water tap
is, to turn it on and put out the fire before the 
damsel gets cooked! 

You need to beware of rolling rocks and flying witches
as you are messing with their supper.
