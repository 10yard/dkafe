Rally-X

The player drives a car around a maze picking up all
of the yellow flags, of which there are ten, before 
the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar 
feel to "Pac-Man"; although in Rally-X, the mazes are
much larger and, with each maze having only ten flags
to collect, is more sparsely populated.

In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try 
to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem 
compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than
the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which 
trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing
enemies to crash. 

Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed 
into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar
display to the right hand side of the playing area 
shows the positions of flags and enemy vehicles.
