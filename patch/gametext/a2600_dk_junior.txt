Atari 2600 Console - Donkey Kong Junior

Mario (known as Jumpman in Donkey Kong) has captured
Donkey Kong and placed him in a cage. Donkey Kong Jr. 
must rescue his father from Mario by working his way 
through a series of stages. Mario attempts to stop 
DK Jr. by releasing animals and putting obstacles in 
his way. 

When DK Jr. succeeds at the final level, Donkey Kong
is freed and kicks Mario into the distance, leaving 
him to an unknown fate.
