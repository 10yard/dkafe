Crazy Kong with Donkey Kong Graphics

An updated version of Crazy Kong (Part 2) that much 
more resembles the original Donkey Kong.  

The sprites/characters are copied and the colour 
palettes are fixed for the wrongly colored ladders 
near some hammers and bonus-items. 
All in all only a few small changes to accomplish 
a much better looking game. 

Why Falcon didn't do this? Was it deliberately making
it look different from the original?
