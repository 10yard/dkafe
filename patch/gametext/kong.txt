Donkey Kong Bootleg for Galaxian Hardware

A bizarre Donkey Kong version by Taito that runs on 
Namco's Galaxian hardware.  The bootleg is also known 
as "Galaxian Kong".

This clone retains all of the gameplay elements of 
Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn and 
re-colorised. 

There is a "Kong" logo upon bootup, and the jumping 
is a lot more jerky than regular Donkey.

Push "Jump" button to start after inserting coins 
instead of the "Player 1" button.
