Donkey Kong Bootleg for Galaxian Hardware

A bizarre Donkey Kong version by Taito that runs on 
Namco's Galaxian hardware.  This is a brazilian 
language version but you can probably work out what 
everything means.

This clone retains most of the gameplay elements of 
Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn and 
re-colorised.  The game features the colourful 
starfield background synonymous with Galaxian.

The collision detection is not great and jumping is a
lot more jerky than regular Donkey Kong.

On the conveyor stage,  you must climb up past Donkey
to reach Pauline via a disappearing ladder.   

Push "Jump" button to start after inserting coins 
instead of the "Player 1" button.
