Crazy Climber

Crazy Climber is a 2-D, strategy style game. The game
is strategic in the fact that you must plan your moves
as you climb up the building and anticipate the 
hazards that await you. 

You start out the game at the bottom of a building to
be scaled. As you climb up the building, you will be 
assailed by bald people throwing flowerpots, signs 
with loose electrical wires, very large apes, falling
signs, trash and barbells, and a bird that likes to 
drop bad things on your character. 

Your goal is to make it to the top of the building and 
catch the helicopter, which will transport you to the 
next building to be scaled. Of course, you will be 
rewarded for quickly making it up the building by 
getting a bonus.
