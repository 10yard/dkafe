Hyper Pac-Man

This is an updated version of Namco's seminal 
"Pac-Man", featuring forced-perspective 3-D graphics
that allow the players to jump over the enemy ghosts; 
in a similar fashion to Namco's "Pac-Mania". 

There are secret items and food to be found on each 
level that increases the player's power and score. 
The power-ups themselves consist of a shield, helmet
lasers, speed and jump shoes. Players will face a boss
encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 
30th stage.
