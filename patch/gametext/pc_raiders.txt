PC - Donkey-Me: Raiders of the Lost Ark

A Donkey Kong and Indiana Jones fusion.
A classc remake with a twist - Indiana Jones is the 
hero.

The game is divided into various phases that represent 
scenes from the movie. The first, for example, is set 
in the beginning of the movie, with the classic scene 
with the giant rolling rock and the golden idol. 
In others, you'll have to reach the lost ark, or the 
truck where Marian was kidnapped.
