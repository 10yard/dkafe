ZX Spectrum 48K - Monkey Bizness

The barrels will roll for a while before Jumpman
appears and you are able to move him.

There are eight levels in all: levels 1 and 2 are 
straight forward. Level 3 has stairs to be jumped;
level 4 has a long jump; level 5 has springs which 
throw the barrels upwards; in level 6 you must contend
with a whole shower of barrels; in level 7 the barrels 
may disappear and re-appear further up and in level 8
you must knock out the 7 weak points in the 
scaffolding.
