Donkey Kong Junior

The game's basic concept is the same as Donkey Kong 
except the good guys and bad guys have changed places.
The player controls Donkey Kong Junior, a small ape 
who must rescue his father, Donkey Kong, from his 
nemesis Mario.

The game has several distinct levels with similar 
goals. Fruit can be dropped on enemies leg traps and 
birds to kill them.
