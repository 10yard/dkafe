Donkey Kong Junior

The game's basic concept is the same as Donkey Kong 
except the good guys and bad guys have changed places.
The player controls Donkey Kong Junior, a small ape 
who must rescue his father, Donkey Kong, from his 
nemesis Mario.

There are several distinct levels with similar goals.

DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab 
vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. 
He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or
climb faster by holding two.

Fruit can be dropped on enemies, snap jaws and birds 
to kill them.
