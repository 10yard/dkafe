Big Kong Bootleg on Galaxian Hardware

This bootleg of Crazy Kong was made to be played on
Galaxian hardware.

This clone retains all of the gameplay elements of 
Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn and 
re-colorised. 

Push "Jump" button to start after inserting coins 
instead of the "Player 1" button.

The game effectively starts at level 11 so you are 
already half way to reaching a killscreen!
The initial difficulty is increased right from the
start though.
