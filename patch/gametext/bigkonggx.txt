Big Kong on Galaxian Hardware

This bootleg of Crazy Kong was made to be played on
Galaxian hardware.

This clone retains all of the gameplay elements of 
Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn and 
re-colorised. 

Ladders on the barrel stage are in different positions
and some rise much higher than usual. They can be used 
to ascend two or three beams at a time, which actually 
makes the game more difficult.

The game effectively starts at level 11 so you are 
already half way to reaching a killscreen!
The initial difficulty is increased right from the
start though.
