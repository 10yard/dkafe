Allen TV

!RWARNING: THIS GAME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE

Allen Stall now has his own TV channel - Allen TV.
His movements are followed closely by a TV camera, 
keeping an eye on what he is getting up to.  Classic!

A very screwed up version of Donkey Kong were you take
control of Allen and help him to reach his dream 1 
Million points.  Allen will vent his joy and 
frustration via the hundreds of included sound samples. 

Allen can select a start level (1, 5, 12 or 17) and be
right on pace for the 1 million points.
