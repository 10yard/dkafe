Commodore 64 - Donkey Kong+ (X2016)

Oxyron decided to remake Donkey Kong from scratch, and
they've ironed out the bugs and ultimately delivered a 
near perfect arcade conversion on the Commodore 64.  

All the levels and cut-scenes are in place.  The score
is no longer squashed up the top to try to copy the 
arcade game, instead the space created to the side by 
the narrow gameplay area has been used, so you can see
your current score as well as the high score.

Enjoy!
