Donkey Kong Crazy Barrels Edition

You play the barrels screen over and over again. But 
the internal difficulty starts where the original 
stops: at level 5. This is called the Agitation Level
of Donkey Kong, displayed on the screen as A=5 and 
goes up with each board that you clear. 
 
Donkey Kong throws a lot more wild barrels than in the
original game.
