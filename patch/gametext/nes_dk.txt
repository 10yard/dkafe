NES Console - Donkey Kong

This NES version of the arcade classic was a launch
title for the console, and is one of the most 
faithful adaptations of the original.

Rescue the kidnapped Pauline from DK’s clutches, 
negotiating increasingly tricky obstacles, and knock 
that pesky primate off his perch!
