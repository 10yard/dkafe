Intellivision - Inty Kong

The sample program "Monkey Moon" was created by
Nanochess as a Donkey Kong clone in the "Programming 
Games for Intellivision Guide".

This program was adapted to include wider platforms,
broken ladders - which Jumpman can partially climb up,
the Oil Can, the Girl shouting "Help" at the top.
Also, barrels can now randonly roll down any ladder as 
well as off the end of a platform.  This means barrels
can group and be more difficult to jump.
The player sprite was changed and uses a colour 
overlay.
