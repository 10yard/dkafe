Intellivision - Inty Kong

An adapted version of Monkey Moon to include wider
platforms, broken ladders - which can be partially
climbed, the Oil Can and a girl shouting for help at 
the top.
Also, barrels can now randomly roll down any ladder as 
well as off the end of a platform.  This means barrels
will group and be more difficult to jump over.
The player sprite was changed and uses a colour 
overlay.
