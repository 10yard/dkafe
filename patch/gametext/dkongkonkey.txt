Konkey Dong

A mixed up version of Donkey Kong.

The rom hack flips the barrels stage so that Jumpman 
must run right to left at the start.
The pies stage is changed slighly too.

The board sequence is: pies, barrels, 
elevators, barrels, rivets for all levels.

Hack Developed by Jon Wilson (10yard)
