MSX - The Apeman Strikes Again

The 'Apeman Strikes Again' is a well done and clone of
Donkey Kong and an underappreciated game on the MSX. 

The digitised voice 'He is coming for you!' is an 
unforgettable line just like the evil laughter you 
hear when Mario falls to his death. 

The game contains all 4 levels.
