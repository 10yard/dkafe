ZX Spectrum 48K - Donkey Kong Remake

This is the ultimate Speccy conversion of Donkey Kong,
head and shoulders above anything anyone else has 
attempted, and if you're a fan of the game then you'll
be very pleased to get your hands on this and fire up 
onto your Speccy.

The game runs smoothly as butter, too, as you leap 
over each barrel and climb up each ladder, aiming to 
rescue your fair lady at the top of the screen. 
The sprite work and animations are excellent and are 
joyous to look at.

Each level has been excellently designed to match that
of the arcade, and no stone is left unturned when it 
comes to the details; even that annoying bouncing 
spring thing makes an appearance in level 3 to keep 
the game authentic. The sound is also on par with the 
arcade, with the beeper used extremely well to emulate
those sounds.
