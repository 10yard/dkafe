Crazy Kong (Part II) Alternative Levels

This Donkey Kong clone retains all of the gameplay 
elements of Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn 
and re-colorised. 

In this alternative levels variation,  the stages are 
made much more difficult and you are given only 1 
starting life.  You will need to be very careful!
