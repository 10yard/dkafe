Qix

The objective of Qix is to claim a certain proportion
of the playing field as your own. At the start of each
level, the playing field is just a large, empty 
rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity 
that performs erratic motions within the confines of 
the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that
can move around the edges of the rectangle. 

To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach
from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix
are lines traced out by moving the marker. When the 
marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by
the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. 

Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can 
safely move along the border of that claimed area. 
To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more 
of the rectangle's area.
