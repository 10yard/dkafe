Donkey Kong Barrels Coach

This coach will help you to master the barrel stage.

The coach visualises safe zones in green - where 
Jumpman is safe from wild barrels. 
Warnings appear when DK releases a wild barrel. 
The barrel control probability is displayed.
Ladders are highlighted when steering is recommended
to divert barrels away from your current position.
A visible hammer countdown timer appears.
Jumpman is repositioned on the 2nd girder as a 
starting point as it is easily reached. Your coaching 
is focussed on the difficult girders.

Good luck!
