Atari 7800 Console - Donkey Kong Remix Demo

A partial port of John Kowalski's Donkey Kong Remix
hack working on the Atari 7800.  In this demo, you 
only get to play one stage that repeats over and 
over.

This is an active project and hopefully the developer
will make further progress with this excellent port.
