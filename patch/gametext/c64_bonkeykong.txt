Commodore 64 - Bonkey Kong

You are Bonkey Kong!  Fulfill your destiny by taking 
your place on top of an unfinished building with the 
love of your life!  (Whom you have plucked randomly 
from the street below)

Throw barrels at the workers who will climb the 
building and try to stop you.

Due to a series of accidents in the 80's, the Kong 
Workers Union have imposed new restrictions:  
Only one barrel can be thrown at a time.
