Vector Kong (Wild Barrels)

A variation of Vector Kong - which is a vectorised
version of Donkey Kong.

The hack suppresses the normal video output completely
and renders high resolution vectors to the screen 
instead of pixels.  

This "Wild Barrels" version is extremely difficult to
master.  A constant stream of wild barrels is being 
thrown down from above.

You play the barrel stage only.
