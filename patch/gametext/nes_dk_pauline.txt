NES Console - Donkey Kong Pauline Edition

When Mike Mika’s daughter was sad she couldn’t play as
a girl character in classic Donkey Kong, her father 
decided a little hacking was in order. 

Mike Mika modified the NES version of the game so that
the damsel/white-knight roles in the game were swapped.
Now Pauline runs, jumps, and dodges rolling barrels to 
save Mario at the top of the screen.
