Donkey Kong Pac-Man Crossover

A crazy mash-up of Donkey Kong, Pac-Man and Galaga.
Jumpman is assisted by Pac-man and a Galaga ship.

Each board contains pellets that must all be picked
up before the board can be finished. You start each 
board playing as Jumpman, but you can temporarily 
transform to Pac-Man by picking up a power pellet. 
When you play as Pac-Man you are invincible.
You can shoot enemies when the Galaga ship appears.
The ship follows Jumpman's position but can be 
controlled independently when Jumpman is on a ladder. 

Thanks to Paul Goes for his excellent Pac-Man hack, 
forming the base for this Galaga variation.
