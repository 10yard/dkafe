Donkey Kong Ends at L=01

Your game of Donkey Kong will end when you complete
the rivet board on level 1.  It's a short game so you 
will have to press for points to get a good score.

A good strategy is to sack your men on the barrels
stage accumulating as many points as possible before
the timer expires.  

If you exit the ladder on the final rivet board then
your game will end - regardless of how many lives 
are remaining.
