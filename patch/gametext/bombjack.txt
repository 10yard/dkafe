Bomb Jack

Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the
aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level 
before progressing to the next. A variety of 
constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the 
platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to
collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress
becomes.

The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear
a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely 
reminiscent of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".
