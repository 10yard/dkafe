Donkey Kong Skip Start

The original Donkey Kong arcade game increases in 
difficulty in the first four levels. At level L=05
the maximum difficulty is reached and stays the same 
for the remainder of the game. 
For pro Donkey Kong players this is considered the 
real start of the game. 

In this romhack the first four levels are skipped and 
the game starts at level L=05.
