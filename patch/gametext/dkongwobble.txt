Wobble Kong

A variation of Vector Kong - which is a vectorised
version of Donkey Kong.

The hack suppresses the normal video output completely
and renders high resolution vectors to the screen 
instead of pixels.

This "Wobble" version introduces randomness to the
vector line drawing and colouration.  The whole game 
wobbles as you play.

You play the barrel stage only.
