SNES Console - Classic Kong

Classic Kong is a 2012 homebrew remake of the classic
Donkey Kong with updated graphics and sound.

The graphics are brilliant. Charming, characterful and
making great use of the SNES' palette, the game looks 
like a top-drawer commercial release with the Nintendo 
Seal of Quality.

The soundtrack is well executed and perfectly fitting 
accompaniment to the graphics and the gameplay, 
bouncing along in a time honoured Nintendo fashion
