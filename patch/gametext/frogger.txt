Frogger

Players must safely guide the frog from the bottom of
the screen to one of five home bases situated at the 
top of the screen.
The lower half of the screen has traffic moving across
five lanes. To navigate across the road safely, 
Frogger's hops must be timed to avoid the vehicles
The upper half of the screen has a fast-flowing river 
populated with logs, crocodiles and turtles. 
Frogger will drown if he has any contact with the 
water and these act as platforms onto which Frogger 
can hop.
A round is completed once five frogs have been guided
safely home.
