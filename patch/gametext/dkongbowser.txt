Donkey Kong Bowser's Takeover

Bowser takes over Donkey Kong's duties and tries to 
make Jumpman's (or shall we call him Mario now?) life 
as miserable as possible. 

Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach and to save her 
Jumpman has to deal with Bowser's evil friends: 
Piranha plants, Koopa turtles and Thwomp blocks. 

Watch out for hot lava and lethal magma bursts while
navigating the various stages. In order to finish any
stage, Jumpman has to collect the three coins scattered
around. And don't miss the 1UP mushrooms that grant you
an extra life. 

Play this ... and embarrass that big bully
