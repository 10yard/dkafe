NES Console - Donkey Kong Fair Maiden Edition

In this hack,  you play as Link, and he is unable to
jump. He is not defenceless though, as he posesses a
sword that can be used up to 3 times per level.

The sword is mapped to the 2nd action button, and
there's a handy counter that appears above the player
whenever the sword is used, to tell you how many uses
are left.

You will need to use the sword sparingly.  Good luck!
