MS-DOS - David's Kong

David's Kong is a classic knock-off of Donkey Kong,
developed by an unknown author (probably named David).
Here the basic object is the same, rescue the maiden 
in distress from the top of the screen while avoiding 
oil barrels and fireballs. Run and jump along the 
platforms to avoid them. 

After rescuing the girl, the level changes a bit and 
you have to run back down. Its CGA four-color graphics
and primitive PC speaker sound effects will be 
nostalgic for people who played this many years ago! 

Probably Developed by David
