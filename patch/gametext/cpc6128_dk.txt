Amstrad CPC - Donkey Kong

Ocean Software‘s 8-bit conversion of Donkey Kong, is 
considered to be close to perfect on the Amstrad CPC. 
All the screens; all the sound effects, and all the 
challenging gameplay elements are present and correct
in this port.

The controls are a little sluggish but you can soon
get used to them.
