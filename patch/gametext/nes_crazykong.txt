NES Console - Crazy Kong

Have you ever wanted to play Falcon’s classic
semi-official Donkey Kong game on your Nintendo
Entertainment System? If yes, then this ROM hack is 
for you.

This hack makes Donkey Kong Original Edition (with the
Cement Factory stage) look like Crazy Kong by changing
the colors, while also making a new title screen.
