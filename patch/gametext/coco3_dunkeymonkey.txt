Tandy Color Computer 3 - Dunkey Monkey

The first level is the "rivets" screen. Mario must run
across all rivets in order to loosen the structure so 
that it falls down. The structure is filled with 
flames which must be avoided. 

A fire extinguisher can be used to put out flames, 
but it will only work for a short while.
The second screen is a combination of the "barrel" 
and "springs" screens,  where Dunkey throws barrels 
down the platforms and Mario must take the lift to 
reach the girl.  This screen is reached only after 
clearing the first screen twice.
