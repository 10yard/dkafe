Donkey Kong Ends at L=05

Your game of Donkey Kong will end when you complete
the rivet board on level 5.  It's a short game so you 
will have to press for points to get the best score.

When you exit the ladder on the final rivet board then
your game will end - regardless of how many lives 
are remaining.
