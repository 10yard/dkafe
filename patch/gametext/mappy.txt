Mappy

You are Mappy, the brave mouse policeman. Mappy's 
mission is to retrieve all of the stolen treasure 
from the Mewkies cat gang. They've stashed all of the
loot in their leader's mansion which contains several
floors, and numerous trampolines that the Mewkies like
to use to travel between stories. 

Mappy must keep away from the cats and collect all 
items in the house before moving on to the next house. 
If Mappy is caught by a cat, he loses a life. Mappy 
also loses a life if he crashes to the floor by 
breaking through a trampoline or falling into a 
pitfall. 
When all of Mappy's lives are lost, the game is over.
