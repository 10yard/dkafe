Donkey Kong Accelerate

In this romhack the speed of the game is gradually 
increased each level until it reaches the maximum 
speed at level L=07. 

At the beginning of the game you must select one of 
the four difficulty settings with different top 
speeds: 
Normal(150%), Hard(160%), Expert(170%) or Insane(200%).

The gameplay is, besides the acceleration, exactly the 
same as the original Donkey Kong arcade game and it 
also killscreens at level L=22. 

Have turbo fun and discover how fast you can get.
