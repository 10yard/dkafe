Arkanoid

After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship
has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 
'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in 
another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is 
charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security 
systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, 
before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien
responsible for the attack.

Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle 
video games.
