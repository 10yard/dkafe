Commodore 64 - Mario's Brewery

Instead of trying to defeat Donkey Kong and rescue 
their girlfriend, the player instead must evade a 
rampaging drink machine. 

The player controls Mario, who can move laterally, 
climb ladders, and jump over dangers. The player has 
3 lives, and loses a life when colliding with any 
danger.

On reaching the top the player must switch off the
drinks machine to progress to the next level.
