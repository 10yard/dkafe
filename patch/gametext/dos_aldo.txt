MS-DOS - Aldo's Adventure

Aldo bears a striking resemblence to Mario in this 
ladder-climbing and jumping game that looks 
suspiciously similar to the original Donkey Kong game.
Obvious similarities aside, this game does feature 
excellent play control, and the game holds up very 
well.
Like Donkey Kong each level fills one screen and does
not scroll. There are several different levels to 
explore.
