Donkey Kong Hard Kit

A version of Donkey Kong with increased difficulty.

This was originally a rom replacement kit which 
replaces the original Donkey Kong board hardware.

It greatly increases the speed and amount of fireballs 
showing on all levels. Such behavior can be seen 
easily on the Rivet Board, where most of the fireballs 
have appeared even before removing the first rivet.
