ZX Spectrum - Kong

The aim of the game is to achieve a high score by 
rescuing Fay Ray from the clutches of King Kong. 
There are four levels in this game. In the first 
screen Kong rolls barrels towards the player who can
smash them with a hammer to gain bonus points.

The second screen is set in a pie factory and the 
player must hurdle oncoming pies on a conveyor belt. 
Level three has the player pursuing Kong up the sky 
scraper in lifts while avoiding falling girders and 
the last level is set in Kong's lair.

Each level starts with a set number of bonus points 
which count down over time so the faster the screen is
completed the more points are gained. Umbrellas and 
handbags can also be collected for bonus points.
