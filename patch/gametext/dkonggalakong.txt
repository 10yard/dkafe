GALAKONG

Jumpman is assisted by an accompanying ship which can 
take out enemies. Bonus points are awarded for 
destroying multiple barrels, pies, springs, fires etc.

The jump button also shoots.

Your ship follows Jumpman's position automatically. 
The ship can be controlled independently when you are
on a ladder.
