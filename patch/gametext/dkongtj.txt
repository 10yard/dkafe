Donkey Kong Twisted Jungle

In this romhack Donkey Kong has kidnapped Pauline and 
took her to his jungle. Jumpman has to save her in 
five brand new jungle themed stages. But the jungle is
Donkey Kong's natural habitat, not Jumpman's! 
Make sure you don't get hit by a coconut, watch out 
when standing on disappearing ground, remove leaves 
and tubers and evade worms, snapjaws and birds. 

Don't forget to pick up the bananas for bonus points.
