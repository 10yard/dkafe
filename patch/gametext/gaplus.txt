Gaplus

A Galaga sequel where you can capture the enemies and
make them work for you by hitting the queen ship when
it dives. The game has the same look and feel as the 
original Galaga. The "bees" were redesigned to look a 
little more modern. A possible contributing factor to 
the game's lack of success in the arcades is that it 
becomes extremely difficult after Parsec 4 or 5. 
Games end quickly!
