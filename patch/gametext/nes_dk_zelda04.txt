in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 
Climb up from the bottom of the dungeon to stop the
big bad and save your friend!

For some reason, now you're a Zol! 
A horrible Digdogger has stolen your Gel kids. 
Save them!
Slime moulds are intelligent beings that can read. 
Bash baddies' noggins in with a Book!
Collect Magical Keys and Clocks for bonus points.
