Q*Bert

Your objective as Q*Bert is to change the color of the
top of the cubes to the Destination Color indicated at
the upper-left corner of the screen by hopping onto 
them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been 
changed to the Destination Color, the screen will 
advance to the next round, with the player-controlled 
Q•Bert character starting back on the top cube. 

Each level consists of four rounds. The current level 
number and round number is displayed at the top-right
corner of the screen.

Gameplay starts with Q•bert appearing at the top of 
the pyramid. The joystick will move Q•bert from cube
to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal 
directions. Q•bert can move anywhere on the pyramid,
but jumping off will kill him.
