Commodore 64 - Donkey Kong (Nintendo)

Jumpman looks like his sprites were ripped out of the 
arcade screen and plastered onto a C64, and are 
startlingly accurate. 
Pauline still cries "Help!" at the top of each level. 
The only one that kind of looks off is Donkey Kong 
himself. He never pounds his chest angrily like he 
does in the arcade, and he looks rather drab. 
Jumpman is slow to move and you have to be almost 
perfectly aligned to ladders, or you aren't going up. 

After launching,  press "Jump" to start a game from 
the games main menu.
