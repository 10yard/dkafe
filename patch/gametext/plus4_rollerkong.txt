Commodore C16/Plus4 - Roller Kong

Your aim is to save the maiden in distress, avoiding
the barrels, fire-bombs and little monsters (spinks)
which are thrown by Kong.  You can gain additional
points by collecting flowers for the maiden on the way
to rescuing her.

On the way, you will find ladders to climb, and the
occasional axe.  Getting the axe will enable you to
destroy barrels and spinks for extra points,  but you
cannot climb the ladders while carrying the axe.

The maiden must be rescued before the deadly spider
reaches her.
