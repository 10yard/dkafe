Commodore 64 - Kongo Kong

It is a blatant clone of Donkey Kong, although it is 
one of the few which has unique level designs. 
Graphically and in terms of gameplay, it is very much 
considered to be vastly inferior to DK, although not 
to the extent that some clones can be.

The game's story, such is it, is that a gorilla has 
escaped a local city zoo and kidnapped a random woman. 

The player controls a nameless firefighter as he 
trapezes through various stages in order to confront 
the gorilla and rescue the damsel. If the player 
"rescues" her three times, they are granted an extra 
life.
