MS-DOS - Champ Kong

CHAMP Kong is a DOS shareware remake of the classic 
Donkey Kong arcade machine. It closely emulates the 
original with two different game modes, the original
"Classic" mode and an enhanced "Champ" mode.

The "Classic" mode plays and feels much like the 
arcade machine, with very similar graphics, sound and
gameplay.

The "Champ" mode is an upgraded version of the classic
game, featuring different levels and more bonuses.
