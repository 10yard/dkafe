Moon Patrol

Moon Patrol is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in
which the player takes the role of a Luna City police 
officer assigned to Sector Nine, home of the toughest 
thugs in the galaxy.

The player controls a moon buggy that travels over the
moon's surface, trying to avoid or destroy any 
obstacles in its path, including craters, rocks and 
mines. UFOs attack the buggy from above by dropping 
bombs, some UFO bombs will create a new crater when 
they hit the ground, generating a new obstacle.

The buggy can jump to avoid craters, mines and rocks, 
it also has both front and vertically-mounted cannons 
that fire missiles simultaneously.

At the end of each stage bonus points are awarded 
based on how quickly the stage was completed.
