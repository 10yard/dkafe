Donkey Kong Heart Hunt

Pauline has placed three hearts on each board. Jumpman
will only be able to finish after he has collected all
three hearts. 

The hearts make the final ladder to Pauline appear on
barrels. On pies it makes the retractable ladders 
start moving. On rivets it breaks the chains that hold 
up Donkey Kong.
