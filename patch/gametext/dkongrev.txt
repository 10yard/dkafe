Donkey Kong Springfinity

In Donkey Kong Reverse, jumpman starts the stages at 
the top of the screen and has to grab Pauline's heart 
at the bottom. And in the rivets stage, instead of 
unplugging the rivets, jumpman has to plug them back 
in. 
In all stages it is a little easier to jump 
fireballs/firefoxes: they do not change direction when
jumpman jumps them.
