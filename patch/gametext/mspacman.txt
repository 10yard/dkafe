Ms. Pac-Man

In this sequel to Namco's legendary Pac-Man, players 
must once again run around a number of mazes, eating 
all of the pills that are scattered throughout. 
The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) 
return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 
'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four 
appearing in each maze.

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements 
over the original game. The first difference is in 
the main character. For the first time in video-game 
history, the game's lead character was female. 
Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original 
character with two main differences; she wears a bow 
in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick.

Another change from the original is that the bonus 
fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly 
around the mazes.

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which 
alternate every two to four rounds.
