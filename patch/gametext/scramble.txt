Scramble

Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up were the
player controls a spaceship and must try to fight 
through six different enemy-packed levels destroying
as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible
before reaching the enemy base and destroying it.

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was
the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.
