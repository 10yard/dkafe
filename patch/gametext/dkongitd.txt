Donkey Kong Into The Dark

In this romhack Donkey Kong unplugs the power source. 
This results in the lights to be switched off. So you 
have to complete the boards in the dark. 

Once every few seconds the lights flash to allow the 
player to orientate. The higher the level the longer 
the pause between the flashes.
