Donkey Kong Barrel Boss

When you start a game, you are thrown in the barrels
board and you do not die when hit by a barrel or a
fireball. When that happens the romhack plays the 
dying music and flashes the background, but you can
continue playing. You can still die when you fall off
a girder. In that case the board starts again and you
have unlimited lifes.

Press P2 to toggle the internal difficulty level.
