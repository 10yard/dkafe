ZX Spectrum 48K - Killer Kong

Killer Kong puts players in the role of a brave hero
trying to rescue a lady from the clutches of a crazy
ape. Players must jump over barrels thrown by the ape,
climb ladders, and navigate girders to progress 
through the game. Along the way, they can also collect
hamburgers for extra points. 

The game features five screens, with the second screen 
introducing lifts for added challenge. Players earn 
points for each barrel jumped and each burger 
collected. The longer it takes to rescue the lady, 
the less love she has for the hero, which affects the 
final score.
