Crazy Kong Bootleg on Moon Cresta Hardware

This bootleg of Crazy Kong was made to be played on
Moon Cresta hardware.

There are some quirks with the game. 
If something moves, don't touch it. If it doesn't 
move, it's either a hammer for bashing barrels or a 
bonus item for picking up umbrella, purse, etc..
