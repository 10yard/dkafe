Mario Bros.

The plot of Mario Bros. is simple but compelling. 
Set in the sewers of New York City, Mario (and Luigi) 
work as plumbers tasked with defeating various 
creatures that emerge from the pipes. Players can work
together to clear each stage, defeat enemies, and 
advance to the next level. 

The primary mechanics involve jumping to knock over 
enemies and flipping them upside down, then kicking
them off the screen to earn points. The game features
a variety of quirky enemies, such as the pesky 
Shellcreepers, Sidestepers, and the dangerous 
Fireball-spewing Fuzzballs.
