Donkey Kong Pac-Man Crossover

Donkey Kong gets help from the four Pac-Man ghosts. 
Jumpman and Pac-man must join forces to save Pauline. 

Each board contains a number of pellets that must all 
be picked up before the board can be finished. You 
start each board playing as Jumpman, but you can 
temporarily transform to Pac-Man by picking up a power 
pellet. When you play as Pac-Man you are invincible 
and can chase and catch the ghosts.
