Donkey Kong 2: Jumpman Returns

This modded game offers a total of 8 levels. This 
includes the original 4 levels, with a few clever 
updates, and 4 new levels: Mixer, Foundry, Refinery, 
and Incinerator. 

The design and play make this game feel like a 
Nintendo sequel.  It's a hard game to master.
