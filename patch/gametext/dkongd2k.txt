Donkey Kong 2: Jumpman Returns

This modded game offers a total of 8 levels including 
the original 4 levels, with a few clever updates, and 
4 new levels: Mixer, Foundry, Refinery, and 
Incinerator. 

The design and play make this game feel like a 
Nintendo sequel.  It's a very hard game to master.
