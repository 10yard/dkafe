Donkey Kong Spooky TV

A halloween themed version of Donkey Kong with new 
challenging stages and bonus levels.

It's challenging to play because the scenarios are 
more complex with more elements mixed together and 
more things to process/anticipate simultaneously 
while playing. 

This hack provides an alternative viewpoint.  Jumpman 
is placed in the centre of the gameplay as he is 
followed around by a camera.
