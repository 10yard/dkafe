Amidar

Rather than moving through a maze (a la Pac-Man), you
instead move along the edges of a series of 
interconnected boxes, trying to ‘paint’ them a 
different colour (or pick up coconuts, depending on 
the level). If you manage to paint around all four 
sides of a box it fills itself in, and the ultimate 
aim on each level is to fill every box on-screen. 
Which is not easy because there are a variety of 
chasing monsters and they are tricky to avoid.

You do have a ‘jump’ ability to help you, although 
pressing jump makes the enemies jump – not you. They
jump, and you move underneath them. Which is weird, 
but it works well enough and can save your skin when 
in a tight corner. You start with only three jumps but
can be awarded more.
