Tandy Color Computer 3 - Donkey Kong Remixed

The classic arcade game has been remixed! With new 
levels and unexpected twists on the classic gameplay!
There's a barrel stage where you have to run down the 
girders instead of up. On one stage a spring bounces 
barrels right back up to one of the top floors. 
On the new Rivets stages, the floors now actually 
collapse when the rivets on both sides are pulled! 
Falling floors can even crush firefoxes/fireballs 
underneath. One of the rivets stages has elevators as 
well, and there is a switch to reverse the elevators 
to be able to get to the top. You can even take a 
hammer with you onto elevators and change floors, etc.
