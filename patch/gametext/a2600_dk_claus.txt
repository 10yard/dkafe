Atari 2600 Console - Donkey Clause

The bitter, evil, but perpetually smiling Ginger Bread
Man has taken over Santa's workshop, enslaved the 
elves, and stolen all the presents. Your job (as Santa)
is to retrieve the presents one at a time.

Screen 1 - Climb to the top to retrieve the present, 
avoiding the mind-controlled hordes of elves. Use the 
workshop hammer to bop them on the head if you so 
desire.

Screen 2 - This scene takes place in the distribution
center for nozama.com, an Internet company(run by the 
Ginger Bread Man) that is slowly putting Santa out of 
business. Before takingthe present, shut down 
nozama.com's conveyor belts by disconnecting them. 
Also, smash a package if you get the chance.
