Commodore 64 - Krazy Kong 64

A refreshing take on Donkey Kong with big colourful
sprites.  Obviously,  Jumpman and Pauline have been 
replaced by giant aardvarks!  DK himself is much less
intimidating with a big smile across his bright face.

Progress up the platforms to rescue an aardvark while 
collecting bonus items on the way.
