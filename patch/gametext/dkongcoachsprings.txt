Donkey Kong Springs Coach

This coach will help you to master the springs.

The coach visualises the safe zones and danger zones
on DK's girder. 
Information about generated springs helps you make 
quick decisions on when to make a run and when to 
sit tight or retreat back to safety.
All generated springs are assigned a "spring type" of
between 0 and 15 depending on their length. The 
shortest spring has type 0, the longest has type 15.
Jumpman is repositioned at the top of the screen ready
to climb the ladder up to DK's girder. This ensures 
your coaching is focussed on the most difficult part
of the stage.

Good luck!
