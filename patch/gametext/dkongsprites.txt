Donkey Kong Sprites & HitBoxes

This is a graphical romhack that illustrates which
graphics are part of the background layer and which 
are part of the sprite layer. Background graphics 
are displayed in blue and sprites are displayed 
outlined in white with yellow dots to indicate the
sprite borders and a red box to indicate the hitbox of
the sprite (when used). The game code is not altered. 

Use this hack to observe: the seperation between 
background and sprites, the actual sizes of the 
various hitboxes, the difference in hitboxes for 
fireballs and firefoxes, the big hitboxes around DK
in rivets, the hitboxes above the oil can, the 
black sprites that cover the top of DK's ladder, and
more!
