NES Console - Donkey Kong 3

Donkey Kong 3 is a frantic action game starring 
newcomer Stanley, whose greenhouse has been invaded 
by the troublesome ape and swarms of angry insects.

Armed with a spray can, you must push Donkey Kong up 
the screen while fending off the swarms of bugs intent
on stealing Stanley's precious flowers.

Avoid the coconuts that DK throws at you, and try to 
grab the power spray can for a few seconds of 
super-charged spraying.
