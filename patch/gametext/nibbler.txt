Nibbler

A maze game where you control Nibbler the snake to eat
food around the maze. With each food you eat, Nibbler 
gets bigger. Complete each level by eating all the 
food on the screen. You lose a life if Nibbler hits 
his own body.

The Nibbler grows in length as it eats dots, making it
increasingly difficult to navigate through the maze.
