Nintendo Gameboy - Game & Watch Gallery 2: Donkey Kong

Game & Watch Gallery 2 features six games based upon 
the Game & Watch brand of handheld games.  Each game 
contains a 'Classic' mode, resembling the gameplay and 
presentation of the original Game & Watch title, and a
'Modern' mode, which contains additional gameplay 
mechanics and revised graphics based on the Mario 
franchise. Normal and Hard difficulty settings can be 
selected for each mode.

You are launched right into the Donkey Kong title from
the frontend. The player moves left and right and jumps
to avoid barrels, making their way up platforms and 
ladders towards Donkey Kong. In the 'Modern' version,
platforms disappear and levels change for greater 
variation.
