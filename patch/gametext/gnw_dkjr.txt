Game & Watch - Donkey Kong Junior

You play as Donkey Kong's son, Junior, and rescue his 
dad, who has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a cage 
by Mario. 

Players use their jumping and climbing abilities to 
clamber up vines and chains, gather vital fruit and 
keys, and open the cage to free their father. Make 
sure to avoid the pesky birds, nasty electric sparks 
and creepy chompers.
