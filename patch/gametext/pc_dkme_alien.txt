PC - Donkey Kong: Alien

A Donkey Kong and Alien fusion.
A classic remake with a twist - Ripley is the hero.

Instead of battling against the big ape, the first 
stage gives you the space jockey. Rescuing Kane at the
end of the second stage results in a pixelated 
chest-burster. 

There’s even an appearance from Jones the cat if you 
can push through to stage number three.
