Amstrad CPC - Climb It

"CLIMB-IT" has 4 magnificent screens of superb graphic
action in solid machine code. You are a heroic young 
man who has to rescue his girlfriend who has fallen in
to the clutches of a giant monkey. To reach your 
sweetheart you must climb ladders, take rides on lifts 
and conveyors, avoiding barrels, fires, pies and 
bouncing beams. 

On reaching the forth screen you have the chance of 
rescuing your beautiful girlfriend.
