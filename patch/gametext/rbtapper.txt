It’s fun! It’s refreshing!

You are a bartender serving root beer to patrons.
You must serve everyone a beer before they work their
way up to the kegs. You must also grab empty mugs 
before they slide off the end of the bar. 
Extra points for collecting tips. Bonus rounds involve
locating the one beer that has not been shaken, and 
serving it.
