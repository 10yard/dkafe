VIC 20 - Hardhat Climber

This Compute type-in is a BASIC take on Donkey Kong 
and Jumpman. You collect items like Jumpman, while the
level design looks like Donkey Kong and you dodge 
barrels...umm...well, ONE barrel.

Despite its simplicity, it’s pretty charming and it 
could serve as the basis for a more interesting game.
