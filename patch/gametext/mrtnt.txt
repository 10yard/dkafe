Mr. TNT

Move along lines, erasing them as you go, to collect
flashing or spinning items. If you collide with one
of the yellow dots that are moving around erasing 
lines or if you end up at a dead end with nowhere to
go, you lose a life. 
A level is cleared when the player has collected all
the dynamite or when all fuses have been burned out. 
The player then moves on to another level.
