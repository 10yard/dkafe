Galaxian

A legendary shoot-em-up! Each screen starts with a 
wave of multi-colored aliens moving left and right at
the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks
and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - 
either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping 
multiple missiles as they descend. 
All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the 
player can progress to the next wave.r.
