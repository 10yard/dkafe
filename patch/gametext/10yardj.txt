10 Yard Fight

It's 3rd and 10. The crowd is on its feet. Cheers fill
the stadium. "36-88-24. Hut-hut-hut." The ball is 
snapped. You grip the hard, cold, pigskin and the game
is in your hands. You scramble left to avoid a flying
tackle and look downfield. A receiver is open. You 
pump a forward pass. It's complete for a 10 yard gain
and a first down.
That's the rush the player gets with 10-YARD FIGHT.

Each level begins with the player carrying the ball on
the kick-off as far up the field as he can before 
getting tackled. Then he's in control as quarterback,
running with the ball or going for a forwards pass 
or a lateral to a receiver who let's him know he's 
open by waving his arms. If the pass is intercepted
a 20 yard penalty is called.

For bonus points after the referee signals a 
touchdown, the player can kick the ball or run with it
to score "points after".
