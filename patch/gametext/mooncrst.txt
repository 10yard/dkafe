Moon Cresta 

Aliens swarm at the top of the screen, swooping down 
on your spacecraft. Your craft begins with three 
segments, one deployed at a time. After the "insect" 
and "fireball" levels, you are able to attempt 
docking the segments together. A successful dock gives
you more firepower for the upcoming levels.
