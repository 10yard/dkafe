Crazy Kong (Part I)

This Donkey Kong clone retains all of the gameplay 
elements of Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn 
and re-colorised. 

Because of its bizarre sound, graphics, and gameplay, 
the game has a loyal cult following.

Crazy Kong was an officially-licensed clone of Donkey 
Kong manufactured by Falcon.
