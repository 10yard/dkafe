Super Pac-Man

As in the original "Pac-Man" game, the goal is to 
clear each maze, but this time, instead of dots, the
maze consists of prizes which are locked away behind 
gates. There are two ways to access the prizes. You 
can eat the keys which open a particular gate, and not
always the gate which is closest to that key. Or you 
can crash through the gate after you eat a Super Pill
and become Super Pac-Man. You are not required to eat 
all of the keys in order to complete the stage.

Four Power Pills are in maze and allow Pac-Man to turn
the tables on the ghosts and eat them for a short 
time. When the ghosts begin to flash, time is running 
out and they will switch back, so beware.

New in this game is the Super Pill. There are two 
Super Pills in the maze which allow Pac-Man to become 
Super Pac-Man for a limited period of time. While in 
Super form, Pac-Man can crash through the maze gates, 
fly over the ghosts and avoid being killed and travel 
at super speed whenever the player presses and holds 
the Super Speed button.
