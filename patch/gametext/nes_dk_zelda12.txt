NES Console - Zelda Kong 12 (Tarin)

This hack changes virtually all graphics and palettes
in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 
Mamu's invaded dream world and has taken Anti-Kirby 
hostage! Save him as Tarin, but don't die, or you'll 
become a Tanuki!
Gather Mushrooms, Yoshi Dolls, Magic Powder, and 
Bananas to raise your points.  Encounter guest 
characters, such as Urchins, Goombas, Piranha Plant, 
Boo Buddies, Pokeys, Cheep-Cheeps, and Mask-Mimics!
