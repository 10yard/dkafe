ZX Spectrum 48K - Donkey Kong

The graphics are poor but the gameplay makes up for
the graphical short comings. The controls are pretty
good and Jumpman feels quite responsive,  apart from
climbing ladders.  Climbing ladders is ridiculously
slow and it will take some adjusting to this game.

After launching, press "Jump" to start a game from the
Spectrum's main menu.
