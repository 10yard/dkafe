Crazy Kong Bootleg for Scramble Hardware

This bootleg of Crazy Kong was made to be played on
Scramble hardware and has additional in-game music.

Interesting version of Crazy Kong due mainly to the 
bright neon colours and the reuse of audio from the 
Konami Turtles/Turpin game.

The game effectively starts at level 11 so you
are already half way to reaching a killscreen!
The initial difficulty is increased though.
