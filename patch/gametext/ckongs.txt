CRAZY KONG BOOTLEG ON SCRAMBLE HARDWARE

This bootleg of Crazy Kong was made to be played on
Scramble hardware and has additional in-game music.

There are some quirks with the game. 
If something moves, don't touch it. If it doesn't 
move, it's either a hammer for bashing barrels or a 
bonus item for picking up umbrella, purse, etc..
