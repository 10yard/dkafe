Eyes

The player controls an eyeball in a maze. As in 
Pac-Man the goal is to collect all of the dots to 
advance to next level, but in Eyes the player shoots
the dots rather than eating them. Computer-controlled 
eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a 
computer eye gives points and removes it from the 
level, but it will reappear a short time later. 
Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.

As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added 
to levels and they take less time to shoot at the 
player. They also move faster. There are eight 
different mazes.
