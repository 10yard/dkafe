NES Console - Zelda Kong 11 (Grandma Ulrira)

This hack changes virtually all graphics and palettes
in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 

Grandpa went to visit Chef Bear but forgot his phone! 
As Grandma Ulrira, trek to the Animal Village to 
return it.
Grab Brooms, Magic Rods, Acorns, and Fishing Hooks for
even more points!
Who cares about any stupid townsfolk in your way? 
Sweep away Mutts, BowWow, Quadruplets, Old Men, 
Trendy Game Guys, and Shopkeepers! YAHOO!
