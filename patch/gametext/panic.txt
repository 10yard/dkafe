Space Panic

The granddaddy of all platform games, as it predates
Nintendo's Donkey Kong (from 1981) which is often 
cited as the original platform game.

Space Panic lacks Donkey Kong's jump mechanic - the 
main character instead digs holes in the platforms 
into which he must lure the aliens. He must then hit
them to knock them out of the hole and off the screen.
In later levels, two or more holes must be lined up 
vertically in order to dispose of the aliens. There is
also a limited supply of oxygen, which functions as a
timer.
