Jr. Pac-Man

One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. 
Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. 
For the first time in the series' history, side 
scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being
two screens wide.

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through 
which players can make an escape. The bonus items that
appear move around the maze and are now something of a 
mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any 
Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn 
any normal dots they pass over into large dots that 
slow the player's movements considerably, but are 
worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the 
player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if
the player loses a life.

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts
(Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all
of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous 
Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow 
Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts.
