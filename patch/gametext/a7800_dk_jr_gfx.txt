Atari 7800 Console - Donkey Kong Junior

This is a sprite & color hack of Donkey Kong Junior. 
The goal was to make the sprites and colors closer to 
the arcade without being too literal with the colors.

Released in 1989 along with Donkey Kong, the Atari 
7800 Donkey Kong Junior is essentially a copy of the 
Nintendo NES version and plays just like it, except 
that its sound is rather weak compared to the NES.

It features three levels, omitting the 'Spark' level.
