Commodore 64 - Donkey Kong (Ocean)

This port hits all of the major points of the arcade. 
All four levels are represented and accurately 
reproduced, as are both cutscenes.  Unlike the Atari 
version, this one includes the "How high can you get?"
screen.  Level progression follows the Japanese 
version of the game.  

Graphically, this Ocean version restricts the game to
the center part of the screen, allowing it to emulate
the arcade's vertical orientation more accurately.  
The tradeoff to this approach is that game utilizes 
even fewer pixels of the C64's already limited
resolution.
