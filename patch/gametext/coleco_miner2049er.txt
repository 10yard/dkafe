Colecovision Console - Miner 2049er

Imagine Donkey Kong with more levels and a miner 
dealing with nuclear mutated animals – that's Miner 
2049er in a nutshell!

Miner 2049er is incredibly similar to Donkey Kong, 
which probably accounts for it's great success and why
we like it so much.

It follows Bounty Bob, a miner who fearlessly travels
into Nuclear Ned's mines while trying to find Yukon 
Yohan.
