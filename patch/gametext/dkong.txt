DONKEY KONG

This is where it all started in 1981.                   

Jumpman attempts to reach the top of a construction 
site where Pauline is being held captive. He can walk 
along platforms, jump, and climb ladders as well. 
Donkey Kong hinders Jumpman from a higher location by 
throwing barrels at him. Jumpman has the ability to 
jump over obstacles or destroy them using a hammer.
