Commodore C16/Plus4 - Climb-It

Climb-It is a 3 screen game.  You are a heroic young
man who has to rescue his girlfriend who has fallen
into the clutches of a giant monkey.

This monkey stays hidden from view but keeps both his
eyes on his captive.  Your mission is to rescue her,
avoiding moving barrels, fires, climb the ladders and
jump onto moving elevators.
