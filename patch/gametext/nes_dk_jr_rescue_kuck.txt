NES Console - Rescue Kuck

Rescue Kuck is a weird bootleg of Donkey Kong Jr that 
was on one of those 64 in 1 carts for the Famicom. 
The sprites are a bit weird including a modified smurf
instead of Donkey Kong and overall just well weird. 

The player character in this game is Conte, replacing 
Jr. The character that Conte has to save at the end of
each stage, (potentially named Kuck), is a recolor of 
the main character, Numen, from another hacked NES 
game, Bruce & Leo.
