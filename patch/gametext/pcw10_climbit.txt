Amstrad PCW - Climb-It

A Donkey Kong clone taken from "The Classic Collection
Volume 2" compilation.

It's a decent clone if you can master your timing when
jumping over barrels.  There are 2 versions of the
barrels stage,  1 with rolling barrels and 1 with wild
barrels.  Other stages are included too.
