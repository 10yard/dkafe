DONKEY KONG JAPAN

The original Japanese release of Donkey Kong from 1981.

It has a different level layout and the kill screen 
comes earlier (Japan ends on screen 85; US ends on 117). 

The barrel screens allow the player to effectively 
"cheat" by waiting near the top of a ladder with no 
risk of barrels rolling down onto Jumpman (the game 
code was modified to disallow this a few months after 
the first batch of American machines rolled out). 

Other than fewer barrel boards and the ladder cheat, 
gameplay is identical between the two versions.
