ZX Spectrum 48K - Donkey Kong Reloaded

Created using AGD (Arcade Game Designer) by Jonathan 
Cauldwell and inspired by the original Donkey Kong 
from 1981.

This version holds more to the tradition of classic 
spectrum platformers as you journey through various 
screens, jumping barrels and avoiding obstacles to
rescue Pauline at the top.
