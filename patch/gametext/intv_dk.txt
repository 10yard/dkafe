Intellivision - Donkey Kong

!!The Intellivision version of Donkey Kong is probably
!!the worst conversion ever.

When the programmers at Mattel Electronics saw the 
Intellivision version of DK, they were shocked at how
bad it was. They actually suspected a conspiracy: that 
Coleco released an awful version for Intellivision so 
that the ColecoVision version would look that much 
better.

More likely it was the result of a rushed schedule and
having no experienced Intellivision programmers on 
staff.
