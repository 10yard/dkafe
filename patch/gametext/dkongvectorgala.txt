Vector GalaKong

A vectorised version of GalaKong which is played
entirely on the barrel stage.

Jumpman is assisted by an accompanying spaceship which
can take out enemies.  Bonus points are awarded for 
destroying multiple barrels, pies, springs, fires etc.

The jump button also shoots.

Your ship follows Jumpman's position automatically.
