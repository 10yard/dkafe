PC - Cook Out!

Cook Out! is a fan game made to look like an arcade 
game Nintendo could have produced circa 1984. 

The objective of the game is to throw veggies into a 
cooking pot while avoiding getting caught by beings 
of fire. 
The game features 4 unique boards and up to 99 levels
of play. How high of a score can YOU get?

Use your 2nd button to pick up and drop the veggies 
into the cooking pot.

This was made for the minigame competition hosted on
the MFGG forums.
