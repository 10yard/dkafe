Pac-Land

Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set
in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has 
lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to
her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely 
hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the 
colourful world until he reaches and enters the 
magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the 
fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his 
trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he 
wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. 
This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back 
home if he so wishes.

Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right
and it's possible to make him run by tapping the 
desired directional button twice. 

The game's stages are called 'trips', with players 
able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip
made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach 
Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short
interval between each one.
