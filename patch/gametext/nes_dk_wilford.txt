NES Console - Wilford Kong

Good lord. Donkey Kong is now Wilford Brimley and he's
chucking oatmeal at you instead of barrels.

Notice that the top score has been replaced by OAT. 
That's right folks, in the world of Wilford Brimley, 
you don't get points... you get oats. And how about 
that bonus time eh? Now it's been changed to FIBER. 
So time isn't measured in seconds, it's measured in 
grams of fiber.

Just as I feared, Donkey Kong is no longer in the 
game.  Instead, he has been replaced by a psychotic 
Wilford Brimley who is hell-bent on delivering 
oaty-pain to you in every inhumanly possible way.
