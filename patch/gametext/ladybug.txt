Lady Bug

You guide a lady bug through a Pac-Man style maze, 
eating dots, and avoiding enemy insects. You lose a
life if you run into a skull or get eaten by an enemy
insect. Collect letters to spell EXTRA for a bonus 
life (just like in Mr. Do!), and SPECIAL for an extra
credit. 

The maze has rotating doors which are just enough to
give the game a slightly different feel than the 
Pac-Man series.
