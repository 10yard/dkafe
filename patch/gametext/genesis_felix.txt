SEGA Genesis Console - Fix It Felix Jr.

Based on the fictional retro arcade game featured in
the 2012 Disney animated film Wreck-It Ralph, 
Fix-It Felix Jr. draws inspiration from Donkey Kong 
and other arcade classics in its defictionalized 
arcade cabinet.

After having his stump moved by a construction 
company, Wreck-It Ralph seeks revenge by damaging the 
apartment building built on his land. The citizens of 
Niceland call on Fix-It Felix Jr. and his magic hammer 
to repair the damage Ralph is dishing out and force 
him off the building, the player climbing from ground 
level to the roof in each new level. Levels are made 
up of multiple screens where shattered windows must be 
repaired by swinging Felix's hammer, the player moving 
up to the next layer after all damage on the current 
screen has been repaired.
