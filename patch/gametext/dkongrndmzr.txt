Donkey Kong RNDMZR

In this romhack, the boards are randomly constructed, 
resulting in a unique layout for each board played. 
The barrels board lends itself best for randomization,
with an algorithm that results in 49000 possible 
variations. 

The game mechanics are not changed, so the game plays 
exactly the same as the original.
