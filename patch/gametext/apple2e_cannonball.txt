Apple II - Cannonball Blitz

The player has to reach the flag on the top. 

The guard sends the cannonballs down, so you must jump
over them. Cannonballs roll on the floors which have 
hatches, that open randomly. 

Also cannonballs fall on the swings which can propel
you upwards, so you have to use them for climbing to 
the upper floor. 
Finally you must catch the balloon to make your way up
to the flag and to the next level.
