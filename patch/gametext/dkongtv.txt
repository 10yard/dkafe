This hack provides an alternative viewpoint, with 
Jumpman fixed in the centre of the gameplay as he is 
followed by a camera.

The camera zooms in further on the action when Jumpman
is jumping or hammering.

Difficulty is increased because you will not get to 
see all of the screen and you will have to 
anticipate enemies and obstacles.

Don't forget to smile for the camera!
