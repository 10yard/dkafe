GALAKONG JUNIOR

A Donkey Kong Junior version of my Galakong hack.  It
mashes up Donkey Kong Junior with Galaga.
Jumpman is assisted by an accompanying ship which can 
take out enemies. Bonus points are awarded for hitting
multiple targets.  The jump button also shoots.

Your ship follows Jumpman's position automatically. 
The ship can be controlled independently when you are
on a vine.
