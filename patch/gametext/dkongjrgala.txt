GalaKong Junior

A Junior version of GalaKong which mashes up Donkey 
Kong Junior with Galaga.

DK JR is assisted by an accompanying ship which can 
take out enemies. Bonus points are awarded for hitting
multiple targets.  The jump button also shoots.

Your ship follows DK JR's position automatically. 
Sitting on a vine and shooting enemies is a good 
points scoring strategy!
