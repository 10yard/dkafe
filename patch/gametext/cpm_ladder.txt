CP/M - Ladder

Ladder is a platform game similar to Donkey Kong 
written for the CP/M operating system and made to be 
operated on the early Kaypro line of luggable 
computers. 

Since the Kaypro only has a text mode, the game uses 
letters, numbers, and symbols lined up to create walls
and platforms, pits/traps, characters, trampolines and 
goals. The floors in Ladder are made of equal signs, 
and the ladders themselves are made of capital "H"s 
stacked on top of each other.
