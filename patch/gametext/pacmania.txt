Pac-Mania

Pac-Mania is a maze-based game in which players 
maneuver Pac-Man through a world of isometric 3-D 
mazes. As with previous games in the series, the 
objective is to eat all of the pellets and power pills
in the mazes while avoiding the pursuing ghosts. 

Pac-Man can now bounce, allowing him to jump over 
ghosts to avoid being caught.

At the start of a game players are given the 
opportunity to choose which of three worlds they 
wish to tackle first: Block Town, Pac-Man's Park 
or Sandbox Land. Block Town is the easiest of the
three and Sandbox Land is the hardest, with more 
points earned for completing a harder world.

Each maze contains four power-pills that make Pac-Man
temporarily invincible, during this time the ghosts 
turn blue and can be eaten. These 'Skinned' ghosts, 
now visible as a pair of eyes only, will then return 
to their den in the middle of the maze, regenerate 
into their former selves, and return to the maze to 
continue their pursuit.
