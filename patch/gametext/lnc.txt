Lock 'n' Chase

Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to 
Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze 
like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of 
the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't 
be easy, since there are four police officers in the
vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located
throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run 
through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily 
close a door in an attempt to block the police. You 
can only close two doors at a time, and any closed 
doors automatically open again after a short amount 
of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been 
collected, the exit to the vault will open and you 
can escape and move on to the next, more difficult 
vault.
