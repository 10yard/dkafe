Ms. Pac Attack

Basically this game is "Ms. Pac-Man", with a few minor
differences. The major difference is that the ghosts 
have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them
more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the 
different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer 
stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the 
maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each 
corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a 
period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

The main difference being the order of levels has been
changed. As in the regular "Ms. Pac-Man" game, the 
maze turns invisible at a certain point. However, in 
Ms. Pac Attacks, this point is reached much earlier - 
at about the 144th screen instead of the 255th.
