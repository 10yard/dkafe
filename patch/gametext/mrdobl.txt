Mr. Do

Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in 
which the player takes on the role of the eponymous 
Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of 
either cherries or monsters. 

The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels
surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. The 
soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, 
allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the 
many cherries that litter the levels. A number of 
apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. 
Do can push them along tunnels (to block or kill 
monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto
the heads of any pursuing enemies. 
Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.
