Crazy Kong Part II 2023 Revision

This is an updated version of Crazy Kong Part II.  
It plays exactly the same as before but this version
fixes all kinds of graphical bugs and glitches from 
the game, re-introduces many of the animations that
Crazy Kong is missing from Donkey Kong and even adds
hammer music.

But the gameplay is the same, including all the tricks
that you can do in Crazy Kong like the floor skip, 
hammer drop and avoiding barrels when you're at the 
top of the ladders.
