Gala TV

A DK TV version of GalaKong

Jumpman is assisted by an accompanying spaceship which
can take out enemies.  Bonus points are awarded for 
destroying multiple barrels, pies, springs, fires etc.

The jump button also shoots.

This hack provides an alternative viewpoint.  Jumpman 
is placed in the centre of the gameplay as he is 
followed around by a camera.
