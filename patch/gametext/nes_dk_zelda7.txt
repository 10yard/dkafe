NES Console - Zelda Kong 7 (Triforce Keeper Edition)

This hack changes virtually all graphics and palettes
in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 
Climb up from the bottom of the dungeon to stop the
big bad and save your friend!

Link failed to defeat his Dark counterpart, so now 
it's up to the Triforce Keeper to destroy him!
The Magical Key, made from enchanted metal, is heavy
enough to make a mess of anyone's face.
Collect Boots and Magic Jars for bonus points.
Make a stand against Bits, Moa, Bago-Bago, evil 
statues Mau and Ra, and Deelers.
