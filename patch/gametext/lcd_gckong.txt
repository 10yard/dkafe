LCD - Gakken Crazy Kong

This version is superior to Coleco's LCD Donkey Kong. 
The movement and gameplay is smooth and the levels 
are interesting and enjoyable.

The first level - has moving rocks that fall from the 
top and roll right/left on the lower levels, a 
conveyor belt that moves right/left (a beep signals 
the change in direction) with moving carts on the 
middle level, and a bouncing fireball on the top level
before you go up to save your maiden.

The second level - slightly puzzley with up/down 
moving platforms, items to get for points, and 
falling rocks accompanied with bouncing fireballs.
