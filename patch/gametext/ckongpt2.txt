CRAZY KONG

This Donkey Kong clone retains all of the gameplay 
elements of Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn 
and re-colorised. 

There are some quirks with the game. 
If something moves, don't touch it. If it doesn't 
move, it's either a hammer for bashing barrels or a 
bonus item for picking up umbrella, purse, etc..
