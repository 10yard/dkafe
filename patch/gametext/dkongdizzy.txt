Dizzy Kong

A variation of Vector Kong - which is a vectorised
version of Donkey Kong.

The hack distorts and rotates vectors to induce a
dizzy experience for the player that increases in
intensity as you progress through the levels.

You play the barrel stage only.

Hack Developed by Jon Wilson (10yard)
