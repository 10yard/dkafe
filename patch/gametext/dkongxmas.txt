Donkey Kong Christmas Remix

A Christmas themed version of Donkey Kong with new 
challenging stages and bonus levels.

It's challenging to play because the scenarios are 
more complex with more elements mixed together and 
more things to process/anticipate simultaneously while
playing. 

The new levels force you to break the muscle memory 
of DK's familiar gameplay patterns & habits.
