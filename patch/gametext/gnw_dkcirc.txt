Game & Watch - Donkey Kong Circus

In this game, Donkey Kong balances on a barrel while
juggling pineapples and avoiding the fireballs falling
from the drums. Mario watches his performance. 

Donkey Kong receives a point every time he catches a 
pineapple. If Donkey Kong loses a pineapple, Mario 
will laugh at him, resulting in a miss. If Donkey Kong
manages to grasp a fireball, he will flail, which also
counts as a miss. If Donkey Kong reaches 300 points 
without any misses, the points will be worth double 
until he does get a miss. If he has any misses at said
 score, every miss will be cleared instead. When he 
 gets three misses, the player gets a Game Over.
