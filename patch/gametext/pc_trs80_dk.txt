Tandy TRS80 - Donkey Kong

A remarkable job of matching the look and feel of the 
original. All the arcade screens are present, although
the graphics are simplified to work with 128x48 screen.
The gameplay even feels the same as the arcade version.
Westmoreland and Gilman wrote Donkey Kong in 1982 but 
never released it due to licensing problems.

Despite its status as unreleased, Donkey Kong is a 
finished game.

Port Developed by Wayne Westmoreland and Terry Gilman
