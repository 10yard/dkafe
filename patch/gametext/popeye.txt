Popeye

Popeye is a platform game featuring characters from 
the famous cartoon show. The aim of the game is to 
rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is 
achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown 
down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as 
hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is 
constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus
(originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run 
away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him 
off the screen (he will, of course, return).

Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, 
they will fall into the water at the bottom of the 
screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to 
retrieve the object or a life is lost.
