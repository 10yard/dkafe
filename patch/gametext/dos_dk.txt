MS-DOS - Donkey Kong

You are Mario, and that big old gorilla, Donkey Kong, 
has run off with your girlfriend. It's up to you to 
struggle up those ladders and balance on those beams 
to rescue your lady fair. She's held captive at the 
very top. But Donkey Kong is not ready to give her up
so easily. He's tossing barrels and fireballs at you
at every turn. It's up to you to outmaneuver that 
wily ape. Good luck, your lady awaits!

The controls in this version are not great.
