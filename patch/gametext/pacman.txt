Pac-Man

Pac-Man is a maze-based arcade game that was released
in 1980, created by Toru Iwatani, a Japanese game 
designer. It was released by Midway in the United 
States. Pac-Man quickly gained popularity, surpassing 
games such as Asteroids and Space Invaders to become 
one of the world's all-time most famous games. 

In Pac-Man, the player controls the Pac-Man character
which looks like a yellow circle with a missing 
pie-shape piece (which represents the mouth). 
 
Pac-Man eats pac-dots as it travels through the maze. 
Once all the dots on the screen are eaten he moves to 
the next level. Pac-Man loses one of his lives if he 
is touched by Clyde, Inly, Pinky, or Blinky - his 
enemies.
