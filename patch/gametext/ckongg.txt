Crazy Kong Bootleg for Galaxian Hardware

A well polished Crazy Kong version developed for
Galaxian Hardware.

This clone retains all of the gameplay elements of 
Donkey Kong, but has the graphics redrawn and 
re-colorised.  Jumpman is blue and white.

There are some deep booming sounds from Kong and
contrasting chirpy walk sounds from Jumpman.  The
noise of springs on the elevator screen is
interesting!  

The game effectively starts at level 11 so you
are already half way to reaching a killscreen!
The initial difficulty is increased though.
