Mouse Trap

Mouse Trap is similar to Pac-Man. The differences are 
mostly aesthetic: the dots become cheese, the player 
is a mouse, the ghosts are cats, and power pills are 
bones that turn the player into a dog. The gameplay of
Mouse Trap differs from that of Pac-Man in the 
following ways: 
The player can open and close the yellow, red, and 
blue sets of doors at the press of a matching colored
button. 
The player can store dog bones for later use at his or
her discretion by pressing a 2nd button
The four ghosts are replaced by six cats, worth 100 
points for the first cat eaten, 300 for the second, 
500 for the third, 700 for the fourth, and 900 for the
fifth and subsequent cats. 
Each cat eaten spawns a slightly faster replacement. 
A seventh monster, a hawk, will eat both mouse and 
dog. Only the mid-screen "IN" field stops the hawk, 
by causing it to move randomly instead of chasing the
player, but this will beam the mouse into one of the 
four corners. 
There is a 10,000 point bonus for clearing the board
of all cheese. 
A player who ends a stage as a dog will begin the next
stage in that form.
