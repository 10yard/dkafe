Tandy TRS80 - Killer Gorilla

The killer gorilla has captured the player's 
girlfriend, and is holding her hostage atop a 
structure consisting of platforms, conveyor belts, and
ladders. The player must move through 4 separate 
stages, trying to reach the top of each. 

Yet more blocky Donkey Kong delights on the TRS80!
