Burger Time

The game was originally titled "Hamburger" in Japan, 
but was renamed "Burger Time" before being exported 
internationally.

When main protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, the player's
character, walks the length of an ingredient, it falls
one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the 
latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed 
when all vertically aligned ingredients have been 
dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. 

Once all burgers are completed, the game level is 
finished.
