Donkey Kong Duel

In this romhack you play a two-player duel with a 
friend to find out who is the best at jumping barrels,
avoiding fireballs, riding elevators and conveyors and
unplugging rivets. A duel consists of a selected 
number of rounds (1-9). 

In each round you play a number of boards in a 
selected board order (US or Japan). Players both play 
the same board. The winner is determined based on a 
selected scoring method.

Enjoy and have some two-player fun
