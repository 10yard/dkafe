PC - Fix It Felix Classic

It's not Donkey Kong but The Fix-It Felix Jr. Cabinet 
from Wreck-It Ralph is based on a Donkey Kong cabinet.

This game is the result of looking at the depiction of
the Fix-It Felix Jr. game in the film, as well as the 
various playable versions, and thinking "What would 
this be like if it was actually released in the early 
80s?". Its goal is not so much to recreate the game 
shown in the movie as accurately as possible, but 
rather to try to be the game that the makers of the 
movie had in mind when designing it, while staying 
close to authentic hardware constraints.

The game provides a stronger challenge than any 
official version, though not an unfair one.
