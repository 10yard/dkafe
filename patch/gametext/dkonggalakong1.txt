Doney Kong Gala-Barrels

This is a variation of GalaKong were you play only the 
barrels stage starting from level 5. 

Jumpman is assisted by an accompanying spaceship which
can take out enemies.  Bonus points are awarded for 
destroying multiple barrels, pies, springs, fires etc.
The jump button also shoots.

Your ship follows Jumpman's position automatically.
The ship can be controlled independently of Jumpman 
when he is on a ladder.  Sitting on a ladder and
shooting enemies is a good points scoring strategy!
