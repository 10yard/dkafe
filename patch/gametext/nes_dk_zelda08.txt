NES Console - Zelda Kong 8 (Child Edition)

This hack changes virtually all graphics and palettes
in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 
Climb up from the bottom of the dungeon to stop the
big bad and save your friend!

Your mum's been caught by a Giant Bubble monster! 
As her child, you should probably rescue her!
You're a Nintendo kid, so of course you have a 'Handy'
Power Glove! Karate-chop stuff to death!
Grab Rafts and Flutes for bonus points.
Escape the clutches of Aches, Leevers, Girubokku, 
Boons, Tektites, and Aneru.
