Commodore 64 - Monkey Kong

Inspired by a TRS-80 game of the same name, it's a 
Donkey Kong clone with a Mario-looking character.

Instead of walking he's hopping his way through the 
levels and controls are slightly laggy, making it 
more difficult than it should be to avoid the random 
attacks of the enemies.  
Bubbles provide temporary protection from the enemies.
