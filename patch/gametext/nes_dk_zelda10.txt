NES Console - Zelda Kong 10 (Marin)

This hack changes virtually all graphics and palettes
in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 

Marin's bestie Martha is being guarded by that lazy 
Walrus! She lost her necklace again, too, so bring it 
back to her.
Collect Ocarinas, Sea Lily's Bells, Bikini Tops, and 
Musical Notes for melodious bonus points.
All the animals of the island are out for blood. 
Rabbits, Cuccos, Toucans, Bear Cubs, Kiki, even the 
flying Rooster!
