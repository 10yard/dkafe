Donkey Kong Junior Continue

A continue option is added to the original Donkey
Kong Junior game allowing you to reach higher levels.  

The continue option appears before your game is over 
with a 10 second countdown timer. Simply push the P1 
Start button to continue your game and your score will 
be reset to zero. 

A tally of the number of continues made will appear on 
screen.
