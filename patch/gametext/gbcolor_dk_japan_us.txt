Nintendo Gameboy - Donkey Kong '94

Like in the original arcade and NES version, the 
player takes control of Mario and must rescue 
Pauline from Donkey Kong (who are both given updated 
character designs for this game). Donkey Kong Jr. 
makes a guest appearance in the game on some levels, 
helping his father hinder Mario's progress.

Donkey Kong begins with the four levels found in the 
original arcade game, in which Mario must reach the 
top of the level and save Pauline. After these four 
initial stages are completed, the usual arcade ending 
begins, but after a few notes of the "victory theme" 
Donkey Kong revives, grabs Pauline again, and takes 
off with her, with Mario giving chase. The player is 
then presented with 97 additional stages spanning nine 
worlds, for a total of 101 stages with the very last 
one a fight against a mutated, larger Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong was awarded Best Game Boy Game of 1994 by 
Electronic Gaming Monthly.
