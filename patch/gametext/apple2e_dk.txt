Apple II - Donkey Kong

Donkey Kong for the Apple II doesn't look like much, 
and some quirks keep it from being a truly great port.
However, this version is commendable for including 
features not usually found in home Donkey Kong ports, 
including the seldomly seen "pie factory" screen, and 
even the in-between "How high can you get?" screens. 

The graphics are decent as far as Apple II games go, 
and the sound is typical of Apple efforts of the early
1980's: sparse and often badly out of tune. 

Still, it's unmistakeably Donkey Kong, and certainly 
playable.
