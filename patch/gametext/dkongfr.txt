Donkey Kong Freerun Edition

In the Freerun Edition you can play the complete game 
without enemies. So there are no barrels, no 
fireballs/firefoxes, no pies and no springs. 

You are free to roam the level screens for as long as 
the bonus timer allows. But beware: you still die when 
you fall off a girder, fall through a rivet hole, jump 
in a burning oil can or miscalculate a jump to an 
elevator.
