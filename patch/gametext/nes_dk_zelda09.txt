NES Console - Zelda Kong 9 (GB Link)

This hack changes virtually all graphics and palettes
in Donkey Kong to resemble The Legend Of Zelda. 
Climb up from the bottom of the dungeon to stop the
big bad and save your friend!

Link, shipwrecked on Koholint Island, finds the Shadow
Nightmare has seized control, and the Owl needs your 
help! Hoot, indeed!
Grab Secret Seashells, Pieces of Heart, Rupees, and
Heart Containers for points. If you collect a lot of
these, something good is bound to happen!
The monsters' power is real! Stalfos, Sparks, 
Darknuts, Traps, Pols Voice, and Wizzrobes have 
crawled out of the dungeons to destroy you.
