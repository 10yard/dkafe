NES Console - Donkey Kong 3: The Great Counter Attack

A Donkey Kong 3 sequel. The gameplay is much more 
simplistic than its predecessor, as you can no longer
jump, and instead the stages revolve around you 
shooting enemies that appear from the top of the 
screen, similar to classic shooters such as Galaga. 
Donkey Kong is located at the top of the screen and 
moves slightly up when you shoot him, though unlike 
Donkey Kong 3, he isn't climbing on poles, but rather 
holding onto two parachutes. 
You win the level if you shoot Donkey Kong offscreen.
