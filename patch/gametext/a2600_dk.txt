Atari 2600 Console - Donkey Kong

"Plays, sounds and scores like the arcade game".
This is how the game was originally pitched by Coleco.
See for yourself!

Coleco's Donkey Kong offers the gist of the arcade
original, but like most home arcade games it suffered
on VCS more than necessary escpecially with only 2 
stages and extremely blocky graphics.

Later releases had improved graphics and more levels.
e.g. Donkey Kong on the Colecovision system by Coleco 
is much better realisation of the game.
