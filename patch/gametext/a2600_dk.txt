Atari 2600 Console - Donkey Kong

"Plays, sounds and scores like the DONKEY KONG arcade 
game".
This is how the game was originally pitched by Coleco.
See for yourself!

Coleco's Donkey Kong offers the gist of the arcade
original, but like most "home" arcade games it 
suffered on VCS more than necessary escpecially with 
only 2 screens and extremely blocky graphics.

Later releases had improved graphics and more levels.
e.g. Donkey Kong on the Colecovision system by Coleco 
is much better than this VCS offering.
