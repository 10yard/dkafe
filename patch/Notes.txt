DKAFE builds the default frontend using patches of the original arcade rom. 

The .ips patches are included with the software.
The orginal Donkey Kong rom is not provided with the software and must be obtained and placed into the dkafe/roms folder as dkong.zip.  It is recommended but not essential for you to also place dkongjr.zip into the dkafe/roms folder too.  
DKAFE will then apply patches and generate the following hacked version of Donkey Kong automaticalluy for you.  The hacked versions will be organised into subfolders of the roms folder.  Folder name shown in brackets below.

----
To make a complete patch file for a hack you need to:
 1. add/replace all files related to the hack into a copy of dkong.zip (you may need to rename some files so that they overwrite originals.  It should be obvious when the files are replacements.)
 2. use IPS patch tool to create a patch of the differences between original dkong.zip and the modified dkong.zip
 3. save the .ips file to patch folder

All completed hacks will be named dkong.zip and placed into a unique folder under /hacks
e.g. dkongspooky.ips will create "<ROM_DIR>/hacks/dkongspooky/dkong.zip"
