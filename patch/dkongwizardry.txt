DONKEY KONG WIZARDY

You play as Jumpman the Wizard trying to rescue his 
girlfriend, Witch Pauline. As Wizard you have a spell
at your disposal to temporarily halt the fires when 
they come too close. You can use this spell once on 
each board and activate it by hitting the P2 button. 

In this game there is more pressure from fireballs, 
so use your magic wisely ...
