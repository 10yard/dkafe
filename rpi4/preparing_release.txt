Pi4 version update steps
------------------------

Insert master SD card (can be created from latest image) and boot to Pi OS Desktop
Press CTRL-ALT-T to start terminal

Abort out of the automated install - if it starts

$ ls
There may be an existing installed "dkafe_bin" folder.
This will be removed automatically by the build script.

$ git clone https://github.com/10yard/dkafe.git
Should create a "dkafe" folder containing the sources

$ ls
$ cd dkafe
$ chmod a+rwx build.sh
$ ./build.sh

The build script will run.  It should create a "dkafe_bin" folder on the /boot partition
There should be no other dkafe or rom stuff on the /boot partition

S ls /boot

If all OK we can now remove the sources

$ sudo rm -r /home/pi/dkafe

Now we're ready to make an SD card image.  Don't reboot - the install script would kick in.
The Desktop should be clear of icons.

Insert USB stick - this will be target for the SD card image.  Recommend minimum 8GB USB stick.

$ lsblk
We can see the USB drive size and mountpoint.  The mounpoint is used in command below i.e. /media/pi/USB

$ sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/pi/USB/dkafe_sdcard.img bs=1M
This will make image of the SD Card (mmcblk0) and save to USB stick.  It will take a while.

$ cd /media/pi/USB
$ sudo pishrink.sh -z dkafe_sdcard.img
This will shrink the image and package into .gz file.  It will take a while.

$ ls -l /media/pi/USB
Job done.

Remove USB stick and transfer over to another computer.
