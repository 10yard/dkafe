Pi4 build and release notes
---------------------------

Insert master SD card and boot to Pi OS Desktop
A master SD card can be created from latest image ideally to 4GB card.

Abort out of the automated install (CTRL-C) - if it starts
Press CTRL-ALT-T to start terminal,  or use SSH to remotely connect to user: "pi", password "dkafe".

$ ls
There may be existing "dkafe_bin" folders at /boot/dkafe_bin and /home/pi/dkafe_bin
These will be automatically removed by the build script.

$ git clone https://github.com/10yard/dkafe.git
To create a "dkafe" folder containing the sources
Note: Github has been failing recently so an alternative is to wget the source zip, unzip and rename directory to dkafe

$ cd dkafe
$ chmod a+rwx build.sh
$ ./build.sh

The build script will run.  It will create a "dkafe_bin" folder on the /boot partition
There should be no other dkafe or rom stuff on the /boot partition

S ls /boot

If all OK we can now remove the sources

$ sudo rm -r /home/pi/dkafe

Now we're ready to make an SD card image.
Insert an empty USB stick - this will be target for the SD card image.  Recommend minimum 4GB USB stick.

$ lsblk
We can see the USB drive size and mountpoint.  Assuming the drive is named "USB"  
The mountpoint used in commands below is /media/pi/USB

$ sudo bleachbit
Optional to clean up and optimise system.  Enable all options except "Memory".

$ history -c && history -w
To clear terminal history

$ sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/pi/USB/dkafe_sdcard.img bs=1M
To make an image of the SD Card (mmcblk0) and save to USB stick.  It will take a while.

$ cd /media/pi/USB
$ sudo pishrink.sh -z dkafe_sdcard.img
To shrink the image and package into .gz file.  It will take a while.

$ ls -l
Job done.
Remove USB stick.
