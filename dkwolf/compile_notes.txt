DKAFE comes bundled with my custom build of WolfMAME (v0.196) which supports only Donkey Kong drivers.  
It a lightweight emulator less than 15mb size.
This version has functionality removed for save and load states, cheats, throttling etc.

The code changes from released WolfMAME v0.196 are included in the "changes" folder.

Changes includes:

frontend/mame/ui/ui.cpp
  removed startup up messages
  disabled load states and save states
  disabled throttling, frameskip, overclocking, rewind/fastforward, cheats, stepping when paused

frontend/mame/mame.cpp
  removed "Initializing..." message

emu/romload.cpp
  removed "WARNING: the machine might not run correctly."
  removed "WRONG CHECKSUMS" message as we are expecting this with our DK hacks.
  removed ROM loading messages
  changed missing ROM error to show message "ROM file was not found.  Please check DKAFE configuration".

emu/config.cpp
  remove save of config files

emu/video.h
  Increase the max frameskip so we can more quickly skip the dk intro scene when user presses jump button.

To build with dkong only driver the SOURCES flag was used in the makefile along with REGENIE i.e.
  SOURCES=src/mame/drivers/dkong.cpp
  REGENIE=1

Other optimisations/flags were
  OPTIMIZE=2
  SYMBOLS=0 
  STRIP_SYMBOLS=1 
  PTR64=1 
  TOOLS=0 

Build time was less than 10 minutes!

For making a lightweight build to support multiple drivers e.g. for a 60-in-1 type setup
  SOURCES=src/mame/drivers/dkong.cpp,src/mame/drivers/pacman.cpp,src/mame/drivers/galaga.cpp etc..
