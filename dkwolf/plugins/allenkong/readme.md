# AllenKong:  It's a screwed up version on Donkey Kong were you take control of Allen and help him to reach his dream 1 Million points

Tested with latest MAME version 0.250

Fully compatible with all MAME versions from 0.196

A very screwed up version of Donkey Kong were you take control of Allen and help him to reach his dream 1 Million points.  
Allen will vent his joy and frustration via the hundreds of included sound samples. 

Allen can select a start level (1, 5, 12 or 17) and be right on pace for that big big big 1 million points.

*WARNING: This game contains Allen and some very strong language.

This work wouldn't be possible without the help of Luke @Mr2NuT123 and the co-operation and consent of Allen Staal @muscleandfitness himself.
