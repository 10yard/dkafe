New in 0.183
------------

 - Forced speed throttling on during recording
 

New in 0.172
------------

 - Added a Playback INP button to frontend, also.  (Please test this out, too)


New in 0.171
------------

 - Added a Record INP toolbar button to the new MEWUI frontend.  (Still a bit experimental, 
   please test it out though)
 

New in 0.169
------------

 - Disabled autoboot_script when recording.
 

New in 0.164
------------

 - Removed pause on quit confirmation while recording.
 

New in 0.159
------------

 - Fixed ui.tcl recording.
 - Removed option of using non-UTF8 characters, since default fonts these days include those
   used by the input viewer.

New in 0.153
------------

 - Changed the INP version number to 3.5, as a point of difference to regular MAME INPs.
 - Source diffs are now based off of the MAME SVN, for (hopefully) easier updating.  Input
   viewer source is now included in the main diff.


Usage
-----

Same as MAME.  Read the docs included with standard MAME for a guide, or go to 
http://www.mameworld.info/easyemu/ if you're completely clueless.

Also included, is ui.tcl.  This is a very simple Tcl/Tk script, to aid in making INPs for MARP,
including disabling NVRAM use for you.  It also has the advantage of working on multiple platforms
without needing any changes (not tested on OS X).  Windows users will need a Tcl interpreter
to be installed to be able to run it, Linux/Unix/OS X/BSD users should be able to just run it as is.

Eventually, I'll rewrite the INP recording and playback guide (again) available at MARP to be more up 
to date.



MARP specific tips
------------------

  - NVRAM is not allowed to be used at MARP, so you'll need to use -nvram_directory NUL or set the
    relevant option in mame.ini.  Substitute "NUL" for "/dev/null" if you're a Unix/Linux/BSD/OS X user.
    It is recommended that you use the supplied batch files for recording and playback.

  - Remember the speed rules, your average emulation speed during must not be less than 90%.  You can
    view your current speed (and the recorded speed if you're playing back an INP) with F11.

  - Pausing is not allowed.  Period.  While the pause functions are disabled when recording, it is still
    possible in other ways.  Don't do it.  We can tell.
