INSTRUCTION = """

Donkey Kong has captured
Pauline and carried her to
the top of an abandoned
construction site.

The shock of shaking up the
building during his ascent
has uncovered many hidden
arcade machines from the
1980's era and they are
scattered around the site.

The coins thrown by Donkey
Kong must be collected by 
Jumpman so he has money to
play the arcades.

Jumpman must play well to
win prizes and unlock arcade
machines as he works his way 
to the top of the building 
to rescue Pauline.  

Pauline will â™¥ it when you
beat all of the machines.

"""

MORE_INSTRUCTION = """

If you are not up for the 
challenge then it is 
possible to adjust things 
and have all machines 
unlocked and set to free 
play. 


Helpful hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
â€¢ Navigate between stages by
  climbing an exit ladder or
  my warping down an oilcan.

â€¢ Use hammers to teleport
  over short distances. 

â€¢ Use the practice modes to
  get better at each stage.  
  Maybe you can reach the 
  infamous Donkey Kong 
  killscreen at level 22-1.

Good luck!

CONTROLS = """

The Controls are as follows:


Left/  â€” Move Jumpman along
Right    the platforms

Up/    - Move Jumpman up and

Jump   - Launch machine that
